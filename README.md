This is the source code for the software used to run the site at [files.javiercampos.info](https://files.javiercampos.info) (a dump of random personal files with no interest whatsoever).
It's a small project made in a few hours during Xmas boredom, to subsitute a very old Apache2 FancyIndexing site I had before.

The source code is presented as-is, and you can use it for any purposes you want. It's made in ASP.NET Core using Razor Pages, in .NET 6.
It uses icons from [https://fileicons.org/ by Daniel Hendriks](https://fileicons.org/), and [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) for the source code viewer syntax highlighter, otherwise all code is mine.
